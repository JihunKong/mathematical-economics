# API Optimization Summary - Fix for 429 Errors

## Overview
This document summarizes the optimizations made to reduce API calls and prevent 429 (Too Many Requests) errors in the Mathematical Economics Stock Trading App.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Optimizations

#### Stock Service Enhancement (`frontend/src/services/stockService.ts`)
- **Added client-side caching** with 10-second TTL to prevent duplicate API calls
- **Implemented batch API endpoint** for fetching multiple stock prices in a single request
- **Added fallback mechanism** with rate-limited individual calls if batch API fails
- **Reduced concurrent requests** to maximum 5 at a time with delays between batches

#### Custom Hook Creation (`frontend/src/hooks/useStockPrices.ts`)
- **Created optimized React hook** for managing stock price fetching
- **Added debouncing** (300ms) to prevent rapid successive API calls
- **Implemented proper cleanup** to prevent memory leaks and orphaned requests
- **Added error handling** with callback support

#### Trading Page Updates (`frontend/src/pages/TradingPage.tsx`)
- **Increased refresh interval** from 10 seconds to 30 seconds
- **Replaced manual interval management** with optimized hook
- **Removed duplicate API calls** on initial load
- **Limited visible stocks** to 20 items to reduce API load

#### Stock Detail Page Updates (`frontend/src/pages/StockDetailPage.tsx`)
- **Increased auto-refresh interval** from 5 seconds to 30 seconds
- **Used cached price data** from stockService

#### Utility Functions (`frontend/src/utils/debounce.ts`)
- **Added debounce and throttle functions** to control API call frequency
- **Implemented RequestQueue class** to limit concurrent API requests

### 2. Backend Optimizations

#### Smart Rate Limiter (`backend/src/middleware/smartRateLimiter.ts`)
- **Created intelligent rate limiting** that adapts based on endpoint type:
  - Standard endpoints: 100 requests/minute
  - Stock price endpoints: 200 requests/minute
  - Batch endpoints: 50 requests/minute (but counted as single request)
  - Trading endpoints: 30 requests/minute
  - Auth endpoints: 5 requests/15 minutes
- **Added special handling** for authenticated users (consume fewer points)
- **Skip rate limiting** for batch endpoints
- **Added API usage tracking** for monitoring

#### Cache Service (`backend/src/services/cacheService.ts`)
- **Implemented in-memory caching** with configurable TTL:
  - Stock prices: 30 seconds
  - Stock lists: 5 minutes
  - Chart data: 10 minutes
  - News data: 30 minutes
- **Added automatic cleanup** of expired entries
- **Created cache decorators** for easy function caching
- **Added cache statistics** and memory usage tracking

#### Controller Updates
- **Added caching to getRealTimePrice** and **getChartData** endpoints
- **Set cache headers** (X-Cache-Hit) for monitoring
- **Return cached data immediately** when available

#### Route Updates
- **Replaced basic rate limiter** with smart rate limiter in all stock-related routes
- **Maintained proper middleware order** for optimal performance

### 3. Rate Limiting Strategy

#### Previous Issues:
- Individual API calls for each stock price
- No client-side caching
- Frequent refresh intervals (5-10 seconds)
- No batch API usage
- Basic rate limiting without context awareness

#### Current Solution:
- Batch API calls for multiple stocks
- Multi-layer caching (client + server)
- Reasonable refresh intervals (30+ seconds)
- Smart rate limiting based on endpoint type
- Reduced concurrent connections

## Performance Improvements

### Expected Results:
1. **80-90% reduction in API calls** through batching and caching
2. **Faster response times** due to cache hits
3. **Eliminated 429 errors** under normal usage
4. **Better user experience** with smoother updates
5. **Reduced server load** and external API usage

### Monitoring:
- Check `X-Cache-Hit` headers to monitor cache effectiveness
- Review rate limiter logs for usage patterns
- Monitor API response times and error rates

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always use batch endpoints** when fetching multiple items
2. **Implement caching** at appropriate layers
3. **Use reasonable refresh intervals** (minimum 30 seconds)
4. **Debounce user-triggered actions** that call APIs
5. **Monitor and adjust rate limits** based on usage patterns
6. **Consider implementing Redis** for distributed caching in production

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the application for any remaining 429 errors
2. Fine-tune cache TTL values based on usage patterns
3. Consider implementing Redis for persistent caching
4. Add more comprehensive API usage analytics
5. Implement progressive loading for large datasets
